1) Part of Speech (POS) Tagging Using Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

2) Authors and Contributions
Ken Masumoto
    For this project Ken implemented the first of two required algorithms - the forward algorithm. In addition to
    implementing the forward algorithm he developed the user interface using the tkinter package and co-wrote this
    report.
Will Bowers
    For this project Will implemented the second of two required algorithms - the Viterbi algorithm. In addition
    to implementing the Viterbi algorithm he found and cleaned the dataset (Brown Corpus) and generated
    transition probability and emission probability matrices for use in both algorithms. He also co-wrote this report.

3) Purpose
For this project we are trying to predict the part of speech for each word in a given sentence. We do this by
utilizing what is called a Hidden Markov model, which is a statistical model used to model systems with hidden states,
hidden states being non-observable features of our system. Both the forward and Viterbi algorithms are methods by
which we can try and estimate these hidden states using observations, albeit they answer slightly different questions
(we will address the differences in the next section). In the case of POS tagging, the observations of our HMM is the
actual word in the sentence, with the hidden state being the POS for each word. Our algorithms will provide a best
estimate as to what POS each word is in a given phrase or sentence.

Forward algorithm

Viterbi algorithm
    The Viterbi algorithm is dynamic programming, decoding algorithm for HMMs. It is used to determine the most likely
    sequence of hidden states that would result in a sequence of observed events. In the case of POS tagging, our
